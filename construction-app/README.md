# Construction Frontend

This project contains a simple React application built with Vite. It demonstrates a minimal user journey for managing construction projects. The interface uses [Material UI](https://mui.com/) and React Router to provide a responsive navigation structure.

## Available Scripts

- `npm install` – install dependencies
- `npm run dev` – start the development server
- `npm run build` – build for production

## Project Structure

- `src/components` – shared UI components
- `src/pages` – route-based pages (Home, Projects, Project Details, New Project)

The app is prepared to connect to a backend via API calls. Placeholder components log to the console when actions occur.
