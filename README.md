# Frontend

This repository contains a React-based frontend for construction project management. The main application is located in the `construction-app` directory and was bootstrapped with Vite.

Run the following commands to get started:

```bash
cd construction-app
npm install
npm run dev
```

The UI follows common best practices for the building industry and is ready to connect to a backend via API calls.
